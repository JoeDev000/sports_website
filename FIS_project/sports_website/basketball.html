      <span class="s1">History Of basketball</span><br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The history of basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield,
      Massachusetts, by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than football. 
      The game spread rapidly, and its popularity grew by the beginning of the 20th century,
      first in America and then around the world. The National Basketball Association (NBA), 
      founded in 1946, had grown into a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the end of the century,
      and basketball had become an integral part of American culture.
